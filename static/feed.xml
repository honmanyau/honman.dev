    <summary>I had a lot of fun re-building this site for third time.</summary>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Following from yesterday&apos;s post: I have just finished re-building this website for the third time (or fourth if you count the Svelte rewrite than I never ended up deploying) and I had a lot of fun!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This post is the first one I&apos;ve ever posted on this website that doesn&apos;t require a build step, all powered by a crappy &quot;CMS&quot; that I hacked together using Deno KV. ðŸŽ‰&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&apos;d already commented on Deno and Fresh yesterday, and I can also now say using Deno Deploy is a fantastic user experience. Granted, this website is a small personal site and has no sophisticated build steps, so time will tell as the ecosystem continues to grow and improve. I&apos;m currently on the free tier and here are some Deno Deploy usage stats:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;418 / 1000000 requests&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;~1 MiB / 100 GiB bandwidth&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;~1700 / 450000 Deno KV read units&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;~300 / 30000 Deno KV write units&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deno KV writes is at ~300 because I&apos;m storing posts with Deno KV and I had to migrate markdown posts from the previous, Nuxt static site and accidentally did it twice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was initially confused by the number of reads but I&apos;d forgotten that the pricing page does specify up to 4KiB per unit, which would make sense since I do have a few call sites that fetch all blog posts (currently ~120 KiB).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For a personal website like this, where I arguably don&apos;t need to store things on the edge, those stats on reads feel expansive. Having said that that, Deno does have a Cache API that&apos;s currently free and in beta; I&apos;ll collect stats for a couple of days and optimise with the Cache API then.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Will likely write more about this later, especially when I try Deno Deploy with larger projects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As an aside, I &lt;em&gt;feel&lt;/em&gt; that this version of the website has been the easiest to optimise Lighthouse scores because of the fantastic tooling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, hi mom, and happy birthday!&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Rewrite with Deno/Fresh mostly done!</title>

    <summary>I was hoping to deploy today and point DNS to a Deno Deploy instance but ended up fussing over small details here and there...</summary>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I was hoping to deploy today and point DNS to a Deno Deploy instance. I ended up fussing over small details here and there because I don&apos;t plan to rewrite with another framework anytime soon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The structure that Fresh mandates makes sense to me. I was able to develop a deeper understanding and be comfortably productive compared to other frameworks in a similar amount of time. It also doesn&apos;t make me feel like I&apos;m constantly tiptoeing the blurred line between client and server. Take this with a grain of salt, they are just personal preferences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, check out &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x2eIhn2BJM&quot;&gt;this interview&lt;/a&gt; with Ryan Dahl on ThePrimeTime. Lots of great stuff in it for engineers of all levels. I&apos;m also super biased because it&apos;s Ryan Dahl.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Questioning \&quot;conventional wisdom&quot;</title>

    <summary>Conventional wisdom is the generally accepted way of doing things.</summary>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Sometimes experienced, well-meaning people offer &quot;conventional wisdom&quot; in a landscape that&apos;s rapidly changing or about to become so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you recognise that the landscape is indeed in flux, you should carefully question any &quot;conventional wisdom&quot; you receive lest you miss the opportunity to prepare yourself for important things.&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I was feeling suer uninspired and came across the release of a product called JamCorder (&lt;a href=&quot;https://jamcorder.com&quot;&gt;website&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you&apos;re musically trained you&apos;ll probably appreciate it a lot â€” I would have instantly purchased it if I had a digital piano. If anything, JamCorder makes me want to buy a digital piano &lt;em&gt;now&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&apos;s also an super awesome how well the idea is executed and marketed (see the introduction video here: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Cjy-zFcUtQ&quot;&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Cjy-zFcUtQ&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Am feeling inspired again.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>We can avoid butchering names</title>

    <summary>Some people have the tendency to say \&quot;I&apos;m about to butcher this name\&quot; before saying a name that they are not familiar with...</summary>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Some people have the tendency to say &quot;I&apos;m about to butcher this name&quot; before saying a name that they are not familiar with. I came across that three times in podcast interviews in just a week â€” in one case I know the interviewer had said that in other interviews, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It makes perfect sense if you have to do it unrehearsed. However, it makes absolutely no sense to say that when you had plenty of time to prepare.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you have given getting it right a good go and still can&apos;t get it, that&apos;s totally fine! In fact, &quot;Is this how you say your name...&quot; is a great way to start a conversation properly while showing that you respect the person you are interviewing and have tried.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&apos;s easier than ever to find out how to say someone&apos;s name properly, so when you say &quot;I&apos;m about to butcher a name&quot; again and again, what you really are saying is that you don&apos;t care enough to try.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stop saying that you&apos;re butchering names if you do try, and start trying if you don&apos;t already.&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Walked past a group of strangers playing jazz at a local library near where I live. As far as I can tell most of them are amateurs, but seeing people &lt;em&gt;making&lt;/em&gt; something out in the physical world is delightful and magical.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, thank you for playing some of my favourite standards! I wonder if they will be there every week...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Your sunny-side up may not be my sunny-side up</title>

    <id>https://honman.dev/posts/your-sunny-side-up-may-not-be-my-sunny-side-up</id>
    <updated>2024-11-08T00:00:00.000Z</updated>
    <summary>A few days ago, I made sunny-side up for some friends I&apos;ve known for a while for the first time...</summary>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;A few days ago, I made sunny-side up for some friends I&apos;ve known for a while for the first time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of them commented on how good the sunny-side up I made looked. I was confused for the moment because I would usually be slightly upset if my sunny-side ups looked anything less than what I made.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It turns out that her family doesn&apos;t eat a lot of eggs for, what she pointed out herself, irrational reasons. The fact that I was a bit surprised that reminded me that I should always consider that what&apos;s &lt;em&gt;normal&lt;/em&gt; to me may not be &lt;em&gt;normal&lt;/em&gt; to someone else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also discovered that some people are against cooking with extra virgin olive oil (EVOO). I was also confused because EVOO is quite stable and fried eggs actually taste better with (extra virgin) olive oil in my opinion. Controlling heat well is a must for any cooking: if you have a look at the smoke point for EVOO and those the proteins and egg yolks and egg whites denature at, it should be pretty clear that it&apos;s totally fine to use EVOO provided that you are controlling heat well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I suppose my sunny-side up isn&apos;t everyone else&apos;s sunny-side up!&lt;/p&gt;
